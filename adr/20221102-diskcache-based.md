# Initial design

ShortMe is an URL shortner that uses SQLite as a persistent storage. SQLite is not
used directly, but through the [diskcache](https://grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache), 
a key-value store on top of SQLite.

Key (the shortened URL) is generated by encoding monotonic counter by [Hashids](https://github.com/davidaurelio/hashids-python). If short version of the URL is provided in the request, it is used as a key and Hashids is not used.

There is no limitations on how many times the same URL can be shortened.
